== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't the plugin do X, Y or Z? =

Because this was designed as an uber small lightweight solution. If you would like more functionality, perhaps try the <a href="http://www.gospelrhys.co.uk/plugins/wordpress-plugins/wordpress-email-capture-plugin">WP Email Capture plugin</a>.

= Will you be adding feature X, Y or Z in a future version of the plugin? =

Probably not.

= Why should I use this plugin? =

If you want a simple yet lightweight way of collecting emails from your site in an email friendly format.

= Does it work for WordPress version x.x.x? =

We only support the latest stable version of WordPress. All other versions you must use at your own risk.

= Why isn't the plugin in my language? =

The plugin supports localization using PO and MO files. If you provide a translation I am more than happy to include it in future releases. If you've translated the plugin please let us know by posting in our <a href="https://geek.hellyer.kiwi/forum/">support forum</a>.
